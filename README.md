Advanced CSS – HTML Structure Project

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. The main objective is to build the full HTML structure of a web page based on a designer's Figma wireframe — with a strong focus on using semantic HTML tags properly.


Project Structure

**Directory:** `css_advanced`
**Files:**
  - `index.html` – The full HTML layout of the page
  - `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)



What’s Included in the Page

The page is broken down into the following semantic sections:


- A `<header>` element
- Inside:
  - A logo wrapped in a link
  - A navigation block with three link elements

Banner
- A `<main>` element with a `<section>` inside
- The banner section contains:
  - A block with:
    - A heading
    - Descriptive text
    - A button
  - A second block with:
    - Another heading
    - A group of 4 feature blocks:
      - Each with an image, heading, and description

Quote
- A new `<section>` under the main
- Contains:
  - An image
  - A nested block with:
    - A quote element
    - Author name
    - Supporting text

Videos
- A section with:
  - A main heading
  - Four video blocks
    - Each with:
      - A thumbnail image
      - A title
      - Description
      - Author block:
        - Author image
        - Author name
      - Rating block:
        - Star images
        - Number of ratings

Membership
- Another section that mimics the video layout
- Four membership options
  - Each block includes:
    - Image
    - Title
    - Text
    - Button

FAQ
- Section with common questions
  - Two rows
  - Each row has two items
    - Each item includes:
      - A question (heading)
      - An answer (text)

Footer
- A `<footer>` element outside the main
- Contains:
  - A row with:
    - Logo image
    - Social media links (as images)
    - A short copyright


Why This Matters

This exercise is all about **writing clean, well-organized HTML** that mirrors a real-world designer's layout — the kind you’d receive when working in a professional front-end or full-stack environment. It prepares the groundwork for adding CSS and JavaScript in future phases.
